# Neural Network From Scratch

Hi! I am a computer science student and this repository is where I am keeping my neural network I am building from scratch! I am doing this project to gain a deeper (pun intended) understanding of neural networks.


## Setup

The only libraries you need to have are listed below with their pip installations

    pip install numpy
    pip install tqdm

## Features

- [x] Backpropagation
- [x] Multiple activation functions
- [x] Learning rate scheduler
- [x] High level network builder
- [x] Momentum
- [ ] Regularization
